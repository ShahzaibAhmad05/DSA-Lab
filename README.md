# DSA-Lab

This repository contains the implementation and solutions for **Labs** of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course at **NUST**.

## Contents
### Lab2
- **hello.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Prints a welcome message to the console.
  - Input/Output: Outputs "Welcome to DSA Lab 2!" to the terminal.
- **salary.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Manages employee salary data with dynamic memory allocation.
  - Input/Output: Takes 20 employee salaries as input and outputs updated salaries after applying an increment formula.
- **string_reverse.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Reverses a user-provided string using dynamic memory allocation.
  - Input/Output: Accepts a string from user input and displays the reversed version of that string.
- **analyze_pointer.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Demonstrates pointer operations and memory analysis.
  - Input/Output: Creates pointers and displays their addresses and values they point to.
### Lab3
- **LinkedList.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a singly linked list with various insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
  - Input/Output: Takes user input for operations (insert/delete/display) and outputs the current state of the list or operation results.
- **queue.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a queue data structure using linked nodes with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
  - Input/Output: Accepts values to enqueue and performs queue operations, displaying the queue contents and operation results.
- **CircularLinkedList.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a circular linked list with operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal in a circular structure.
  - Input/Output: Takes values for insertion/deletion operations and displays the circular list structure and operation outcomes.
### Lab4
- **tower_of_hanoi.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a Game of Tower of Hanoi and a Algorithm that solves it.
  - Input/Output: Takes in how many disks the game should include and displays Information about how the Algorithm solves it including the number of total moves.
- **braces_checker.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Tests if an mathematical expression makes correct use of closing and opening braces for all types of braces ( () , [] , {} ).
  - Input/Output: Takes a mathematical expression in form of a string as Input and displays whether the expression makes correct use of braces or where there was a mistake.
- **string_reversal_using_stack.cpp**:
  - Purpose: Implements a reversal of a string using a stack.
  - Input/Output: Takes a string for reversal and displays the reversed string.
